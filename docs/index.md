# Intro

Bioinformatic analysis can be quite messy at times - complex data wrangling operations, multiple versions of the same analysis (Supervisor: '*Hey - we should add this bit!*'; later: '*Hey - we should drop that bit...*'), parallel working environments (local/ cluster) are all out for your sanity.

The following is a presentation of how I (currently) organize my stuff to not get lost. Of course there are probably a zillion of other ways you can organize your workflow and there are some aspects that might be helpful but I did not have the time yet to implement/get to know yet. Therefore this tutorial surely is biased towards my personal preferences/experience and is merely meant as template that you should tweak to you own liking.

It will cover the following topics:

- **Basic Setup**: Organization of your files & how to get to the command line
- **Bash**: The native Linux language (basics)
- **Cluster**: How to get to the (GEOMAR) high performance computing cluster
- **Git**: version control, connectivity & collaboration
- **R** RStudio, RStudio projects & my favorite packages
- **Nextflow**: organizing your analysis
